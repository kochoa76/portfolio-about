                      <h4 class="text-dark pt-1" >Career in Sales</h4>
                      <p class="pt-1">Growing up I wasn't aware a career in web development existed. My journey to discovering a community of digital creators and thinkers began more recently.  Five years ago I started a career in sales at a tech-startup in Boston. Armed with a business degree, and a fierce determination, I was excited to enter the tech world. It took a few months to adjust to the startup life, but I enjoyed --and still enjoy-- the thrill of taking on new responsibilities, making quick decisions, and constantly learning something new. I relished the hustle, and soon enough I was promoted to a closing sales role. With practice and dedication, I became a top seller in the company.  Although I had been successful, I knew sales wasn't the skill I wanted work on every day of my career, so I began to re-evaluate what I wanted.</p>

                      <h4 class="text-dark pt-1">Technology + Create</h4>
                      <p class="pt-1">I took an honest look at what I enjoyed doing at work, and I kept finding myself coming back to technology. As a sales rep, you and your engineer are first to witness the user's problem. In my case, I sold disaster recovery/business continuity solutions for businesses. If a company were to lose power or control of their applications, business operations would stop working and the company would lose revenue. Our software provided a needed solution.  Working with technical engineers and clients sparked a curiosity to bridge the gap between solving customer problems and creating technical solutions. It got me thinking that perhaps what I was missing at work was the ability to create.   </p>

                      <h4 class="text-dark pt-1">Shift in Mindset</h4>
                      <p class="pt-1">That spark of interest turned into a shift in my career. I reignited a passion for learning, and soon enough a love for code. The more I learn today, the more I recognize technology's incontrovertible connection between an initial idea and the end product, and find it pretty exciting. I'm grateful for a career selling technical solutions and what it's taught me, but looking ahead I am most excited to learn from a career building those solutions, and contributing to this thriving community. </p>
